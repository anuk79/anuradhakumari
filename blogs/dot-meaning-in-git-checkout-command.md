Today I came across a git command named `git checkout .` and since I had never used or saw it before, I googled to understand the usage for it.

TLDR; it writes content from index. That is, it undoes unstaged local modification.

**Resource:** The [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14460595/git-checkout-with-dot) has a very good explanation.

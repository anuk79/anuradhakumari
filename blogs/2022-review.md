Hi everyone, how are you all celebrating the new year? As we say hello to the new year of 2023, I wrote my year-end review for 2022.

## 2022 Goals

Similar to [2021](https://dev.to/this-is-learning/2021-reflections-and-whats-next-in-2022-4jha), I did not put any specific thing on my list, rather I went for a theme and for better focus on three areas.

### Theme

The year 2022 was my year of saying **No** to self-deprecating thoughts, diminishing my caliber and my achievements, and doubting if I could do new things.

I did try to live by this, and I had to push myself at times to think positively and own my work.

There was a time when I felt too uncomfortable when I was appreciated, but now I have started to acknowledge my wins, and that's a big mental shift for me.

I still feel I hold myself back often, and I will continue working on this in 2023 as well.

### Areas of focus

I focused mainly on three areas in my life:

1. Better Health
2. Live Life
3. Growth

## Health

In 2022, working on improving my health was my number one priority. But I had a few low moments due to my health this year. It was a struggle for most of Jan and Feb and later during Oct and Nov. But two worst instances were when I got covid for the first time, it hit me hard, physically as well as mentally. I am so glad that I recovered from it. Another low was resurfacing of a health condition I thought I got rid of, and currently I am under treatment.

So the biggest focus in 2023 remains on my health, to be consistent in eating healthy and maintaining healthy habits.

## Life and Growth

2022 was the year I felt what living life to the fullest could feel like. I pushed myself to explore new places, travel to different countries, learn new things, try new activities, and I feel amazed as I look back on my 2022 journey. I have grown personally, mentally as well as professionally. I have so much to share, I will go month-wise:

### January

- Got awarded as [Microsoft MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5004678?fullName=Anuradha%20Kumari) for developer technologies and it was a perfect new year gift
- Gave a talk at UK & Ireland DevFest - I love speaking and sharing my experiences, and in 2022 I wanted to continue speaking at multiple conferences, so a great start to the year
- Emceed at the GraphQL galaxy conference, this was also one of the goals to emcee at a few conferences, and I am on the right path

### February

- Explored Amsterdam for the first time, with my friend [Gift](https://twitter.com/lauragift_) (I came to the Netherlands at the end of September 2021, but due to covid and lockdown, I never went out to explore till now)
- Also explored Haarlem, and went to Teyler's museum and it was a great experience. Walking alongside the canals was so beautiful, I can never get tired of the canals, they are magical
- Spoke at 2 events - CityJS Conference, India, and GDSC (World Of Wonders)
- Emceed 2 conferences - JSWorld conference and Node Congress. I realized that I really enjoy emceeing and it's super fun to chat with speakers while learning about a wide range of topics at the conference

### March

- Was mentor in RoadToGDE Class 3
- Emceed at the DevOps JS conference
- Visited 2 museums - Naturalis and Hortus Botanical in Leiden, it was lots of fun
- Tried go-karting for the first time, but since I do not know a bit about driving, I injured myself, so I quit after one lap. I would never try this again until I have learned real car driving. I love to try new things, but with caution, and I do not feel ashamed to quit if needed.

### April

So many firsts happened this month, and it has been one of the most happening months of 2022:

- I witnessed [snowfall for the first time](https://twitter.com/miracle_404/status/1509675670334578688?s=20&t=TxNr55sJSQj4Eu0vvHYJLw) ever, it was a beautiful amazing experience
- and I felt as if it snowed to wish me luck for my first in-person international conference as a speaker, in front of more than 700 people later that day - at [React Live conference](https://twitter.com/miracle_404/status/1510121286822989824?s=20&t=TxNr55sJSQj4Eu0vvHYJLw)

- Probably one of the defining moments of this year - [indoor sky diving](https://www.instagram.com/p/ClV5MdWMgVk/) in Utrecht with my colleagues - I have dreaded sky diving like anything, so it took a lot of courage to even decide to try it, but the moment I fell into that tunnel - I felt a different energy in me, and after those 3 minutes of sky diving experience in that tunnel, I felt like I got this new confidence and like I was a new person, and now I feel much less scared to try new things.

I am also very grateful that I got these opportunities and my workplace has always supported me.

And, I am grateful for meeting and making so many wonderful friends, you all are amazing, thank you for being there!

## Hello, 2023 - what's next?

And now to welcome the new year, a blank book of 365 days that we have to fill with experiences.

- Focus the most on being healthy
- Speak and attend more in-person conferences this year too, sharing my experiences, meeting old and new friends, and learning from fellow speakers.
- Continue speaking at online events too.
- I enjoyed emceeing a lot, and I would continue emceeing a few conferences, and I would really like to emcee some in-person conferences too
- Continue traveling to new places, and exploring new things.
- Give more workshops this year
- I wrote only 2 blogs in 2022 and would focus on writing more this year
- Create more videos for my YouTube channel
- Continue reading more books

### Three new things I would like to do this year

These terrify me currently, so I should try and get past my fear:

- Learn Driving,
- Parasailing,
- Learn Swimming

## Theme of 2023

And with that, **Going above and beyond** would be my theme for the year 2023.

I would like to explore more of my potential, see what I am capable of, and how far I can go while living life to its fullest.

> A very happy and wonderful new year to everyone, I hope this year is the best year yet.

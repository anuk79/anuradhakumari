Today I learned about the **details** tag in HTML which can be used for creating a collapsible widget with a label and information.

Pretty similar to the widget which I created for the [TIL view of my previous website](https://anuk79-old.netlify.app/quicktips/) using JavaScript. I would have used it if I knew about it earlier.

It has a good browser support with only exceptions of Internet Explorer and Edge versions before 79.

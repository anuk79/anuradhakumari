Today I came across a neat trick on how to read the github public repository using an **1s** in the github url.

## What was the issue?

Let's say I want to read the code for my repo at [UnitTestingReactUsingJestAndEnzyme](https://github.com/anuk79/UnitTestingReactUsingJestAndEnzyme)

But I will have to open files one by one, and then go back to the root level to access any other file. But today I learned that by altering the URL slightly, we can get experience of an online VSCode editor.

The code is readonly, but it is very helpful as it helps us navigate through code and folder structure the way we actually use while coding on any IDE.

## Solution

Check the new URL below:
[http://github1s.com/anuk79/UnitTestingReactUsingJestAndEnzyme](http://github1s.com/anuk79/UnitTestingReactUsingJestAndEnzyme)

Notice the extra **1s** after github in the URL. That, dear friends, is the trick. So neat, and super helpful, right?

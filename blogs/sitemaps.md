Today I did some research on sitemaps. I had a vague idea about them - that they contain the information of all the pages on our website and how to reach those links.

But, I had never created any sitemap before. I read most of the content on google search console help and created one basic sitemap for my existing website - [Explore accessibility](http://explore-a11y.netlify.app)

Happy New Year to everyone and I hope you all had a good start to 2025. As we welcome a new year, it's time for me to reflect upon the year that 2024 was and write a review. 

I have been doing these year-end reviews for the past 3 years ([2021](https://www.anuradhakumari.com/blog/2021-year-in-review), [2022](https://www.anuradhakumari.com/blog/2022-review), [2023](https://www.anuradhakumari.com/blog/2023-review)) and I enjoy writing this and reading it later. 

Although I always write and publish these write-ups by the first week of January, 2025 started differently. At first, I felt pressure, to publish this soon, and then I realized there was no real rush. It's my review and I can publish it when I can. So, here we go...

## Dancing through the storms

2024 was a terrific year, chaotic yet beautiful. At times, it felt like I was weathering storm after storm, and I wasn't sure I could make it through. 

But now, looking back, I realize that not only did I overcome those challenges, but I did so while showing up for myself and excelling in the key areas of my life.

I had a variety of experiences, tried many new things, read extensively, learned a lot, and traveled far. I also gained a deeper understanding of who I am and what I want.

I believe that 2024 was the year that prepared me for an even more beautiful and amazing future, and I am forever grateful for that.

## Healthy and Happy

I started 2024 with the theme of *Healthy and Happy* and I did try my best to follow through with that. There were hiccups with my health, but I tried my best to live a healthier life. I am going to continue that this year as well.

## Good times

Good times and lots of laughter with my family and friends, both in the Netherlands and India. I spent a significant time meeting and connecting with friends this year. 

I am grateful to be blessed with amazing people in my life who check up on me and who I can rely on, and they are just like my family here. I also met lots of new people this year and made new connections (thanks to travel and conferences largely).

I mostly travel solo, but I also enjoyed traveling to some amazing places with my friends this year, like Ghent, Cologne, Luxembourg, Giethoorn, and Anna Paulowna.

2025 has also started on a good note on this aspect and I am going to continue to plan and meet my friends more this year as well. To more good times and a lot of laughter and shared experiences.

## Career

I joined my current company in November 2023, so 2024 has been a year of exploration — getting to know my role better, understanding company objectives, and technologies used, and contributing to my team’s goals. It has been a valuable and ongoing learning experience.

I also enjoyed incorporating accessibility into my daily work and learning from my colleagues along the way. 

Looking ahead, I’m excited to focus even more on growth and making meaningful contributions.

## Speaking at conferences

In 2024, I had a great time delivering **3 workshops and 7 talks** across different countries. These experiences allowed me to meet new people, gain insights into the tech scene in various cities, and learn from other speakers at these events. 

It was both enriching and inspiring, and I look forward to continuing this journey in the coming year.

I also had major wins in this area as I continue to be [Google Developer Expert](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7289340186797240320/) and [Microsoft MVP](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7217094291184099330/) for another year as well.

I am honored to be part of these programs and I am looking forward to another year of impactful contributions and collaborations.


## Traveling around the world

2024 was an incredible year for travel, as I set out to explore more of Europe. I traveled to 12 countries this year, and they brought me so much joy. Two of my most favorite visits were:

1. **UK**: Cambridge, London, Middlesbrough, and Whitby
2. **Greece**: Athens, Mycenae, Nafplion, and Epidaurus

The best part of travel is the stories that we will tell for years to come, like the one I have from [CityJS Athens](https://x.com/miracle_404/status/1863489327847625133).

In 2025, I am looking forward to more travel memories.

## Reading 

I read some books in 2024, and then some more, and then some more. And thanks to Goodreads, [my 2024 year in books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2024/105616872) tells me that I read **53 books** in total. 

I explored different genres and thoroughly enjoyed the journey of learning, gaining knowledge, and experiencing the wisdom of incredible authors.

A few of my favorite reads are:
- [Tuesdays with Morrie](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6900.Tuesdays_with_Morrie)
- [Born a Crime](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29780253-born-a-crime)
- [Unmasking Autism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59916224-unmasking-autism)
- [The Midnight Library](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52578297-the-midnight-library)
- [Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46041199-kim-jiyoung-born-1982)

2025 has started well for reading. Since January was a bit of a struggle for me, books provided me with the safe space for my mind like they always do. My goal for this year is to read more and explore more books from authors around the world.

## Trying new things

In 2024, I embraced trying new things, and each experience was incredibly enriching. I started learning to swim, visited a board game café and a cat café, and even tried Lego building—all of which I thoroughly enjoyed. 

I also did an escape room, which was a lot of fun, and attended The Lord of the Rings movie with orchestra, an absolutely breathtaking experience. Another highlight was attending the premiere of a famous Dutch show at Bijlmer Arena, where I got to enjoy a wonderful red carpet moment.

Throughout the year, I followed my heart and booked experiences I was excited about whenever I traveled to a new country, creating countless beautiful memories. 

In 2025, I’m committed to continuing this journey—stepping out of my comfort zone and trying even more new things.

## More time in nature

I wanted to spend more time in nature, and I did just that—enjoying long walks on beaches, through dunes, and in forests, all while taking in breathtaking sunsets. 

These moments brought me so much happiness, and I look forward to experiencing even more of them in 2025.

## Thank you 2024

All in all, 2024 was the year I lived to the fullest. 

I feel so proud and grateful for everything, and I feel so *blessed to have lived through 2024* ❤️.


## Greetings 2025

I am looking forward to this new year, and my theme for 2025 is **Go for it**

> This year, I’m going to live boldly, passionately, and to the fullest.

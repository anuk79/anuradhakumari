Today I learnt about [Event listener breakpoints in Google Chrome DevTools](https://dzone.com/articles/debug-javascript-using-chrome-developer-tools).

This is really useful for scenarios where we would like to debug out code when any particular event gets fired. The code execution is paused at that point and we can take a look at the variables values at that moment, and anything else that we would like to debug.

Today I discovered [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest) snippet extension for Visual Studio Code.

As I am an advocate of writing unit test cases, I find myself writing unit tests pretty frequently.

Currently I am working in a project which uses React for development and Jest for unit testing the code. When writing test cases, we add each test case under `it`. But when typing **it** VS Code always autocompletes to **instanceof** and I have to rename it.

So I searched on how to fix that and hit the stackoverflow link with exact issue solved with help of the extension [vscode-jest-snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andys8.jest-snippets)
